      <h1>About me</h1>
      <h5>Photographer</h5>
      <p>I approach photography with a romantic, fine art sensibility. 
        My imagery is understated yet evocative, resulting from clear and polished creative direction that elicits light-filled,
         painterly portraits. My use of fresh and simple composition, and natural light has evolved from a deep love and respect 
         for the old masters - Rembrandt, Vermeer, Botticelli. I am a fiercely dedicated medium format film photographer and my 
         creative process is imaginative, industrious and detailed. In each capture, I aim for perfection and beauty.
